            "Spice The most pronounced element in a jerk marinade (besides the heat) is typically allspice, the round, firm berries of the indigenous pimento tree.\n",
            "On the Grill \"Good jerk has slightly dry, dark, crusty edges from the heat,\" Suzanne Rousseau says.\n",
            "Peppered across the island, roadside jerk stands entice passersby with wafts of fragrant smoke rising from makeshift grills encased in sheets of tin siding.\n",
            "This, along with the influence of pimento wood and leaf smoke, is the key to jerked meat that tastes like it does in Jamaica.\n",
            "In the Oven If grilling is not an option, jerk can be cooked indoors using high oven heat.\n",
            "Although jerk comes across as a leisurely beach food, it's actually a dish of resistance, born out of necessity and circumstance.\n",
            "“Jerk is not a seasoning; it’s a type of cooking,” Michelle says.\n",
            "Two Ways to Cook Jerk To grill or not to grill?\n",
            "Nonetheless, the marinade—a fragrant mixture of Jamaican Scotch bonnet peppers, ginger, garlic, herbs, and spices—is a necessary component.\n",
            "It's typically eaten with your hands alongside fried cornmeal \"festivals\" (dumplings), scorching-­hot Scotch bonnet pepper sauce, and cold beer.\n",
            "In either case, serve the chicken or pork with lime wedges and some extra marinade on the side.\n",
            "You've got some meat, some vegetables, some wood—and you've got a way to make a living.\"\n",
            "Pungent fresh aromatics, such as ginger, garlic, scallions, and thyme, are ground into the mix to add body and bite.\n",
            "Other spices typically include cinnamon, nutmeg, and lots of coriander, which brighten the overall result.\n",
